# ToDo Crud

This web application creates, reads, updates and deletes tasks.

## Getting Started

1. This requires a server with Laravel, PHP and MySQL.
2. Set the root directory on the server to 'public' .
3. 'AutoIndex' should be turned off.
6. To config the app to use your database, edit the .env file (not included) on the project's root directory. Just change the user, psw, dbname and dbhost.
7. To create the tables, you need to migrate the migration file with the command: php artisan migrate
8. The app should be accessible now by entering the private IP or 'localhost' in the web browser's address bar.
